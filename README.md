## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**🔑 API Key Problems**

- Ensure your Gemini API key is correctly set in `.env` file
- Verify the key has proper permissions and is active
- Check for API quotas, rate limits, or billing issues
- Restart development server after adding/changing the API key

**📄 File Processing Errors**

- Verify file is not corrupted, password-protected, or image-only
- Check file size doesn't exceed 10MB limit
- Ensure PDF files contain extractable text (not just scanned images)
- Try re-uploading the file or use a different format

**⬇️ Export & Download Issues**

- Enable pop-ups in your browser settings
- Check browser download permissions and default download location
- Try different export formats if one fails
- Clear browser cache and try again
