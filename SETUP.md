# AI Cover Letter Generator - Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

1. **Gemini API Key**: You need to get a free API key from Google AI Studio
   - Visit: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
   - Create a new API key
   - Copy the API key

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ai-cover-letter-generator
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Open the `.env` file in the root directory and replace `your_gemini_api_key_here` with your actual Gemini API key:

```env
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
VITE_MAX_FILE_SIZE=10
```

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:5173`

4. **Review & Edit**: Review the generated content and make edits if needed
5. **Download**: Choose from PDF, Word, or HTML formats

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- API keys are stored in environment variables
- File processing happens client-side
- File size and type validation
- No data is stored on servers (client-side only)

### üöÄ Performance Optimizations

- Lazy loading of heavy libraries
- Efficient file processing
- Optimized API calls with proper error handling
- Responsive design for all devices

### üîÑ Error Handling

- Comprehensive error messages for file processing
- API error handling with user-friendly messages
- File validation with specific error descriptions
- Graceful degradation for unsupported features

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"React is not defined" error**

   - Make sure all React imports are properly added
   - Check that JSX files have React imported

2. **API Key Issues**

   - Verify your Gemini API key is correctly set in `.env`
   - Ensure the API key has proper permissions
   - Check the API key is not expired

3. **File Processing Errors**

   - Ensure files are not corrupted
   - Check file size limits
   - Verify file types are supported (PDF/DOCX only)
   - **PDF Processing**: Uses browser-compatible `pdfjs-dist` library

4. **PDF Worker Issues**

   - If you see "Setting up fake worker failed" errors
   - The app automatically copies PDF.js worker files to the public directory
   - Worker files are served locally for better reliability
   - Check that `/pdf.worker.min.js` is accessible from your dev server
   - If issues persist, try clearing browser cache and restarting dev server

5. **Module Externalization Errors**

   - If you see "Module has been externalized for browser compatibility" errors
   - This usually means a Node.js-only library is being used in the browser
   - The app uses `pdfjs-dist` instead of `pdf-parse` for browser compatibility

6. **Export Issues**

   - Modern browsers required for PDF export
   - Enable pop-ups for download functionality
   - Check browser compatibility for all features
